structural deformations and its applications protein-DNA interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My little contribution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my PhD work, I attempted to explain the effect of CpG methylation on
shape-readout, one of the binding recognition mode, utilized by Transription
Factors (TFs). The details can be found
